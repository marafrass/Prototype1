# DESIGN JOURNAL CART 310

## Prototype 1 - Blexen

I usually set out to make comedic/narrative games, so for this project, I wanted to go in a complete opposite direction.



## What are the barebones mechanics needed to make a simple first person shooter engaging in both play and feedback?



In order to quickly work out the prototype, I opted to rework and mod one of the Unity template projects - the "FPS Microgame", which features a first-person character controller, base enemy templates and projectile systems. Beyond these core systems, there were a slew of minor features - a HUD compass, ammunition, objective trackers, and so on - and these were the first to go. The intent was to scale down as much as possible and remove everything that wasn't essential to the core experience of the shooter.

On that note, I had to figure out what exactly the core experience of the shooter was - as such, I went back to play the classics. DOOM, Hexen, Blood, etc - these games were to be my main source of inspiration, even if the goal of my prototype was even simpler. Point, run and shoot - and never stop. The question posed at the start of this journal states "engaging in both play and feedback," which I will go on to explain below:

1. #### A core tenet of the shooter is skill-based action. The game should continuously provide tense tests of skill in the player, to facilitate a feeling of being tested, and of being in danger, with outplaying the enemy the only solution.

2. #### The game itself should feel impactful. Firing a gun should feel powerful, both in sound and visual feedback. Moving around should feel fast and fluid - no matter if you hit a key or a mouse button, the impact should feel direct and powerful.

3. #### The "Game Feel" should be the type that makes you swing around in your chair, your whole body bobbing and weaving around the enemies.



### Tackling movement

Movement was the first important step in making the game feel right.
